How many of those did you have as a sophomore? Last year’s UCLA game, where she just took over and almost singlehandedly won the game, how many did you have? Of leading the team, Dangerfield said, “You have to take more responsibility for what happens, what goes wrong. “In order to be great at that position, you have to have a certain personality type,” Auriemma said. Crystal is going to have to do that every game. UConn women’s basketball fans got their first look at the 2019-20 Huskies, including three of the program’s newcomers, in a 103-40 exhibition win over Division II Jefferson Sunday afternoon at Gampel Pavilion.
